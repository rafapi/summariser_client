# Client app for the Text Summarisation API

## Details
* The core funtionality of this app is to consume the REST API located here: https://desolate-stream-75858.herokuapp.com
* That API expects a URL pointing to an article that we would like to summarise and will return that same URL back along with the articles title and the articles summary.
* This app is written in Dart/Flutter and has been tested on Android and iOS devices.

## TODO
* Improve readability
